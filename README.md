# Woken

A prototype for a fast-paced multiplayer first-person shooter built on Unreal Engine.

## Description

This is Woken, a prototype for a fast-paced multiplayer first-person shooter built on Unreal Engine. Woken is my first project in game development and primarily served as a sandbox for learning and exploration. It allowed me to engage with various aspects of game development like networking, player movement, map design, level building, animation programming, SFX, UI, and many others. Mainly, it allowed me to gain valuable fundamental programming experience in my development of the core gameplay mechanics.
